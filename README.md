# How to create "My First Mojio" Android application

### Requirements
1. **Android Studio**: Android Studio is now the official IDE and developer tools for building Applications. Because of this, these instructions assume the usage of Android Studio. Please visit http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html for more details.

### Using the Mojio Android SDK
Please see https://github.com/mojio/mojio-android-example-oAuth2/blob/master/README.md for details on how to setup the Mojio SDK, and make a basic OAuth2 call.

### Adding Google Maps
This demo showcases placing vehicle data on a Google Map. For this to work, you will need your own Google Maps API key. Please see https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android/ for details on creating one.

Once you have your Google API key, make sure to update the sample's AndroidManifest.xml file to include this key.
